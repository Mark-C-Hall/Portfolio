## About

> IT student at Arizona State University.

I am very fascinated by the concept of automation. I love the idea of coming up with a template and executing that in scale. I have experience with AWS, as well as programming experience in Python, Go, and JavaScript.

I am hoping to break into the DevOps world. I try to get my hands dirty by setting up various projects in AWS.

When I'm not working, I enjoy traveling with my partner and dog in our camper van. We enjoy hiking, mountain-biking, and climbing. I love all things astronomy and stargazing.
