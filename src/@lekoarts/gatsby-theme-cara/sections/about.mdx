## About

> Emerging DevOps, Site Reliability, and Cloud Engineer

As a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a degree in IT, I am deeply passionate about DevOps Engineering and the transformative power of automation. My journey in the tech world has led me to hone my skills in AWS, Linux, and networking, and I'm proficient in programming with Go, Python, and TypeScript.

My commitment to building efficient, scalable systems in a microservice architecture has driven me to excel in areas such as infrastructure as code using Terraform, continuous integration and deployment with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD, and containerization leveraging Docker and Kubernetes. With a keen eye on the evolving landscape of DevOps, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and tools that enable me to craft innovative automated solutions.

Beyond the realm of technology, I find balance and inspiration in nature. Alongside my partner and our dog, I venture into the great outdoors in our camper van, engaging in hiking, mountain biking, and climbing. These activities not only offer adventure but also a sense of rejuvenation. Additionally, my interest in astronomy and stargazing sparks my curiosity about the universe, encouraging me to approach complex challenges with a fresh perspective.

Driven by a passion for both technology and the natural world, I am eager to embark on my career as a DevOps Engineer, where I can contribute to the field of automation and infrastructure management while continuing to grow and embrace new challenges.
